MPC-Enabled Crowdfunding Platform â€“ Private Funding with Threshold Reveal

Brief: a crowdfunding platform where contributions are submitted privately. The total funds raised are revealed only if a predefined funding threshold is met. This model allows backers to support projects without exposing individual contribution details, leveraging MPC to secure and aggregate the data.

Key Criteria:

Confidential Contributions: Each contribution remains private until the overall goal is reached.
Threshold Mechanism: Use MPC to reveal total funds only when a certain threshold is met, ensuring no partial disclosure that could affect contributor behavior.
Robust Contract Logic: The smart contract should handle fund collection, threshold checking, and secure final disclosure.
User Interface & Documentation: Clear instructions for both contributors and project owners, with a straightforward mechanism to verify that the funding total is accurate and computed fairly.
